# yati -- Yet Another Transformer Implementation

This project implements the Transformer model, as described in
"Attention is All You Need" (AIAYN).  The model is of the encoder/decoder
variety.

The main goal of the project (aside from being an interesting learning
exercise) is to be as faithful as possible to the description in AIAYN.
Any ambiguities and assumptions are clearly documented.
